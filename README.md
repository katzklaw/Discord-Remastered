# 💿 Discord Remastered — A Flow in Shadows

*Crafted in stillness, designed for the bold.  
Where servers drift sideways, and the vibe flows like a lucid dream.*

## 🌌 Description

**Discord Remastered** is a sleek, transparent Vencord theme built for the dark side of Discord — literally.  
It transforms your interface into a clean, flowing, glassy experience with:

- A **horizontal server list** for a modern layout  
- **Glassy transparency** that gives depth and calm  
- **Rounded corners** on messages and menus  
- **Hover effects** on channels, DMs, and servers  
- A **smart member list** — only avatars show until you hover  
- Built **specifically for Dark theme** users
- **Fun extras**: "soandso is typing" changed to say "soandso is yapping" AND the position of the server tag and role emoji are swapped.

All credit to @L4zyC0re. I made very minor edits. Changed theme color from red to blue, added a subtle background, and fixed the missing "inbox" button on the top bar. ~katz
